# Lager Addon for Vanilla WoW (v1.12)

Lager is a super light-weight addon for World of Warcraft (version 1.12) that reduces lag by pausing superfluous combat logs.

## How does 'Lager' work?

You actually don’t need 'Lager' because this addon just automatically executes the following commands, which you can also input manually in-game:

/run SetCVar("CombatLogRangeParty", 0)
/run SetCVar("CombatLogRangePartyPet", 0)
/run SetCVar("CombatLogRangeFriendlyPlayers", 0)
/run SetCVar("CombatLogRangeFriendlyPlayersPets", 0)
/run SetCVar("CombatLogRangeHostilePlayers", 0)
/run SetCVar("CombatLogRangeHostilePlayersPets", 0)
/run SetCVar("CombatDeathLogRange", 0)

The benefit of having this addon is, you can easily toggle it on and off at your convenience. I recommend activating it during intense 40-man raid combat and deactivating it when you're not experiencing lag.

## Side effect
When you activate 'Lager,' other combat-related addons, like the DPS meter, may not function as intended.

## Features

- Toggle combat log distances between minimum and maximum settings.
- Display current combat log status in the chat.
- Minimap button for easy access and control.
- Simple command interface for additional functionality.
